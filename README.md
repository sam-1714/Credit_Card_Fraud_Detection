Credit Card Fraud Detection
Examined a highly imbalanced dataset (284,807 transactions with only 0.17% fraudulent) using Python, performing
detailed univariate and bivariate Exploratory Data Analysis to uncover critical patterns in fraudulent transactions.
Developed and optimized machine learning models Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest
Neighbors with Grid Search, achieving up to 93% recall in fraud detection.
Evaluated performance through F1 Score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curves, and identified Logistic Regression
as the most effective model for imbalanced classification
